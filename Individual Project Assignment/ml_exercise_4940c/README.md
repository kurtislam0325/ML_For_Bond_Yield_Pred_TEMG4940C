## Machine Learning PA
### Overview
The ML Assignment consist of 7 Parts, namely: 

Part 0. Loading Dataset from Path 

Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Showcase Existence of Missing Value, Outliers & Imbalances in Dataset
Handle missing values & outliers
Explain why a particular methodology is chosen for handling each cases - Missing Values + Outliers
Plot 3+ Graphs to explore datasets 
Describe 3 observed patterns & explain how would the observation alter approaches on upcoming data preparation/modelling
Part 2. Data Preparation

Identify Data Type of Each Column & Respective Data Preprocessing Methods
Perform the aforementioned Data Preprocessing
Part 3. Modelling   

Generate Test/Training Data Split
Choose and deploy dataset to 3+ ML Model
Part 4. Evaluation

 Evaluate the Model's Accuracy
 Indicate which model would you eventually pursue & the underlying rationale
Part 5. Optimization

Attempt Manual Hyperparameter Tuning
Attempt K-fold Cross Validation to find the best Hyperparameter 
Attempt one of the 3 ensemble methods
Part 6. Interpretation

Plot 3+ Graph that effectively explain insights that you uncovered about the trained model, comment to describe the insight that was uncovered
Part 7. Machine Learning Dashboard

Transfer Graphs plotted in Part 1d, 4a, & 6 into a web-based dashboard
