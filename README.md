## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Accurate pricing of credit bonds is never an easy task and one that requires precision as well as efficiency given the many variables involved and fast-moving pace of the financial world. Working together with industry veterans with decades of experience in credit analysis and bond pricing, this course aims to establish the role of credit rating migration probabilities and credit spread volatilities to predict changes in bond pricing using Machine Learning techniques.  Students will use publicly available data sources, such as Eikon Terminal to export historical data for machine learning algo training. Students are free to source additional information available in the public domain. Final deliverable is a presentation explaining the key idea of student's ML-based prediction tool for bond portfolio construction, execution and ongoing management.  

There are 3 parts to the course. 

**Part 1: Self-study 4 topics (June 19 to July 7, Week 0-2).**  Each topic comes with detailed instructions of which online courses or Youtube videos to watch, programming exercises and/or quiz for assessing learning outcome. Students will also learn how to use Eikon terminal in the SBM computer barn for finding and exporting data for ML algo training.

Web-based GUI development - Github, JavaScript and REACT
Machine Learning algorithms - Data preparation, and ML algorithms
Business Finance concepts - Investment products, ratios, bond valuations, credit rating and defaults
Refinitiv Eikon terminal - How to search and export company financial data or macroeconomic data

**Part 2: Corporate sponsor workshops (July 8 - 22, Week 3-5).**  Two project sponsors each with over 25 years of industry experience will deliver workshops to help students understand basic concepts in institutional crediting rating by agencies such as S&P and Moody's, credit rating migration, correlation between bond pricing and crediting rating and other parameters. 

**Part 3: Prototype development and final presentation (July 29 - Aug 19, Week 6-9).**  Students will be assigned to a team of no more than six in week3.  Instructor will conduct team assignment by balancing work experiences, study major and courses completed.  Students will organize themselves for team-based development.  Every week, student team will present weekly progress and discuss next step with two corporate sponsors. Final presentation is for students to present to project sponsors and the class of the design of the project, ML algorithm accuracy and a demonstration of their working prototype.
